description: I believe we'll see more websites, especially personal sites, moving away from huge frameworks with bright colours and flashing images and more toward simple layouts and text-centric content approaches.

A hundred million new internet users are coming online in the developing world thanks to the advent of low-cost, internet-connected featurephones such as those running on KaiOS. For the first time ever, users are taking their first steps into the internet on screens as limited as 240 x 320 resolution. Unfortunately their browsing experience will be marred by [biased standards](https://dev.to/shemthedev/is-the-future-of-the-web-text-centric-3ck9) of the modern web. As a kind of tribute, I want to highlight five excellent examples of developer websites whose designs scale perfectly down to minimal screen sizes.

Zoe's website is the pinnacle of a modern developer website. Taking a single-column approach, her website scales flawlessly down to our minimum resolution without a single thing out of alignment and not a pixel of horizontal scroll is needed. A text-first, image-lite experience means that loading is lightning fast and there is plenty of content to consume on the homepage alone.

Franco's site is as minimal and text-centric as it gets with a uniquely vibrant colour scheme, darkmode toggle and fully responsive design. Franco's website loads lightning fast and is **user experience first** with no tracking cookies, analytics or third-party integrations.

Lyndsey is rightfully a legend around these parts and her website is nothing short of cosmic. It's a much more maximalist style with plenty of media content and fancy animations that somehow renders absolutely perfectly down to our minimal screen resolution. Not a pixel is out of place on any page even at a tiny screen size!

Do you know any developer websites which adapt perfectly to minimal screen sizes?
